# Tea Cozy - Fictional Tea Cafe Website

This is my redesign of the Tea Cozy project from Codecademy's Front End Engineer career path. The website is fully responsive and includes additional concepts such as CSS smooth scrolling. All fonts, colors, and styles are my own.

The fonts used is [Roboto-Condensed](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto+Condensed) and [Pacifico](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Pacifico?preview.text=tea%20cozy&preview.text_type=custom).

## Original Design

This is the [design spec](https://www.dropbox.com/s/pn49f1fdswpmjwb/Tea-Cozy-Design-Spec.jpg?dl=0) given by Codecademy.
